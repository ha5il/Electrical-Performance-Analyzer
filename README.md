# Electrical Performance Analyzer

**An Arduino UNO based project for data recording with analysis by php code or console app**

> These are the codes written for following hardware components interfaced to Arduino UNO

- SD Card Module
- Bluetooth Module
- Voltage Sensor
- Current Sensor
- Speedometer
- LEDs
- Buzzer
- RTC Module

**Processing is used to show real-time graph**
Although we have installed Bluetooth module to pass real-time values to mobile. This can be extended by creating a native app to show a dynamic graph, but we are using processing for the same.

**Firmata can be continued..**
There are some standards to be followed to build Firmata based app and code on Arduino. Yes, this will make everything real-time including the dynamic graph feature.

**Analysis by PHP**
Server side code is written to analyse DATA.CSV file.

**Analysis by Console Application**
This app is written in C++ in Visual Basic 2017 for analysis of DATA.CSV.
